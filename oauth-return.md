### Please stand by

Not being redirected back to the app and keep getting stuck on this page?

Make sure you have the latest version of Chrome for Android installed and it is the default browser. 

From version 3.0.x there is a fallback option, that can be used by copy/pasting below code.

<div id="myworkaround">OAuth code is: N/A</div>

<div id="myworkaround-copy"></div>

Copy above code to clipboard, press back button until you see account screen in FolderSync, press fallback button and enter code.
