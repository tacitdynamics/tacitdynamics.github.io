## Sending log file to support
If you  have a specific problem with the app, then please include a log file using the procedure below.
Please only send log files if requested by us.

### How to create and send a log file
1. To create a log file with useful data, enable [Debug logging] on the app's about screen.
2. Redo the function/action that fails so it gets logged (previous errors will not be logged, so this step is important).
3. Go back to the about screen and export the logs to zip file.
4. Send the logs to [support mail](mailto:support@tacit.dk).
